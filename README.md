In my spare time I create app in .NET Core, C++ and scripts in Python.

I love learn new technology.

My 2nd biggest technology hobby is create electronic devices -- create PCB in Eagle/KiCad, programming sensor or microcontrollers and create case on 3D print in Inventor/FreeCAD.

### Actually I create big Web project in .NET Core and 2 electronic projects... More information soon on Github in repo...

### STAY TUNED!
