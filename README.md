In my spare time I create app in .NET Core, C++ and scripts in Python.

I love learn new technology.

**My new goal: learn Go language**

My 2nd biggest technology hobby is create electronic devices -- create PCB in Eagle/KiCad, programming sensor or microcontrollers and create elements on 3D print in Fusion 360/Solid Edge.
